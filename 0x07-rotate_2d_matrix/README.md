This project involved a common DSA question of rotating a 2D matrix or array

## Algorithm
Let size of row and column be 3. 
During first iteration – 
a[i][j] = Element at first index (leftmost corner top)= 1.
a[j][n-1-i]= Rightmost corner top Element = 3.
a[n-1-i][n-1-j] = Rightmost corner bottom element = 9.
a[n-1-j][i] = Leftmost corner bottom element = 7.
Move these elements in the clockwise direction.

During second iteration – 
a[i][j] = 2.
a[j][n-1-i] = 6.
a[n-1-i][n-1-j] = 8.
a[n-1-j][i] = 4. 
Similarly, move these elements in the clockwise direction.
